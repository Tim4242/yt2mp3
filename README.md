# yt2mp3
GUI bash script to download, tag, and organize mp3 files from youtube videos.

This script uses a zenity interface to make downloading mp3 files from youtube videos simpler. 
You can manually download songs one by one, or use a text file to create a list of songs to download.
Every track will be saved into a directory corresponding to the artist, inside your default Music directory.
The end result will be a neatly organized Music folder, with each track being properly tagged and then stored in a directory named after the artist, for easy navigation and transfer.
